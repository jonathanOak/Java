# Java
Contains a project from my course at Endicott. A word-based game. It was my first attempt to make something of my own.
In this project I used:

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Libraries
- Dot notation
- Case and While Loops
- Nested If Statements
- Mathematics

Also, some of the exercises from the Java course on the Coursera platform:

- Arrays, Lists and HashMaps
- Parsing Log Files
- Encryption
- DNA Analysis
